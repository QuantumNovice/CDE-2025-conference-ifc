> Research toolkit for knowledge-informed semantic alignment and rule interpretation that automates ICT compliance checking on BIM data. The project targets IFC-centric workflows, integrates with design coordination, and aims for reproducible, auditable rule execution.

## Highlights

- **IFC first**: focuses on robust parsing and validation on real project data  
- **Rule reasoning**: maps human readable requirements to executable checks  
- **Repeatable runs**: deterministic pipelines for certification grade outputs  
- **Extensible**: modular design for custom rules, datasets, and integrations
